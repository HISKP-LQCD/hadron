  abstract = "It is shown that certain sequences of Hankel matrices of finite rank obtained from a given sequence of complex numbers and powers of companion matrices are closely related. This relation is established by investigating the algebraic properties of combinations of polynomial multiples of powers of complex numbers. Among many applications, these properties are used to construct polynomials with zeros being a function of the zeros of given polynomials. For example, Hankel matrices of finite rank are used to develop a method for computing the least common multiple of a finite number of polynomials without factoring them, or computing a polynomial whose zeros are the product of the zeros of two polynomials. A method for computing a factor of the characteristic polynomial of a given matrix is also presented and is established by forming certain types of Hankel matrices whose entries are generated from linear combinations of powers of zeros of its characteristic polynomial. Applications of these ideas to signal processing and computational linear algebra are also given."

  abstract="The analysis of non-stationary signals using time-frequency representation (TFR) presents simultaneous information in time and frequency domain. Most of TFR methods are developed for real-valued signals. In several fields of science and technology, the study of unique information presented in the complex form of signals is required. Therefore, an eigenvalue decomposition of Hankel matrix-based TFR method, which is a data-driven technique, has been extended for the analysis of complex-valued signals. In this method, the positive and negative frequency components of complex signals are separately decomposed using recently developed eigenvalue decomposition of Hankel matrix-based method. Further, the Hilbert transform is applied on decomposed components to obtain TFR for both positive and negative frequency ranges. The proposed method for obtaining TFR is compared with the existing methods. Results for synthetic and natural complex signals provide support to the proposed method to perform better than compared methods.",
