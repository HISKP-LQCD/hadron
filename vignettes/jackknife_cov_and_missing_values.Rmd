# Missing column

We create some data and replace one column with `NA`.

```{r}
data <- matrix(rnorm(120), ncol = 10)
data[, 3] <- NA
print(data)
```

The covariance, with the implicit `use = 'everything'` will give us a “cross” of `NA` in the covariance matrix.

```{r}
cov(data)
```

The jackknife covariance does the same thing.

```{r}
jackknife_cov(data)
```

# Missing row

When we have some `NA` values in a row, we have a conceptual problem with the jackknife as the width of the jackknife distribution is linked to the number of measurements.

```{r}
data <- matrix(rnorm(120), ncol = 10)
data[2, ] <- NA
print(data)
```

Also here we get the same behavior by default:

```{r}
cov(data)
```

```{r}
jackknife_cov(data)
```

When we use `complete`, we get the same thing as just dropping the `NA` rows.

```{r}
cov(data, use = 'complete')
```

```{r}
all(cov(data, use = 'complete') == cov(data[complete.cases(data), ]))
```

With our jackknife function we get a failure, which should not happen!

```{r}
jackknife_cov(data, na.rm = TRUE)
```
