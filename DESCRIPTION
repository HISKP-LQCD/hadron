Description: Toolkit to perform statistical analyses of correlation
   functions generated from Lattice Monte Carlo simulations. In
   particular, a class 'cf' for correlation functions and
   methods to analyse those are defined. This includes (blocked)
   bootstrap (based on the 'boot' package) and jackknife, but also an
   automatic determination of integrated autocorrelation
   times. 'hadron' also provides a very  general function
   bootstrap.nlsfit() to bootstrap a non-linear least squares fit.
   More specific functions are provided to extract hadronic quantities
   from Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics simulations, a particular Monte
   Carlo simulation,(see e.g. European Twisted Mass Collaboration, P. Boucaud et
   al. (2008) <doi:10.1016/j.cpc.2008.06.013>). Here, to determine
   energy eigenvalues of hadronic states, specific fitting routines
   and in particular the generalised eigenvalue method (see
   e.g. B. Blossier et al. (2009) <doi:10.1088/1126-6708/2009/04/094>
   and M. Fischer et al. (2020)
   <https://inspirehep.net/literature/1792113>) are implemented.
   In addition, input/output and plotting routines are available.
