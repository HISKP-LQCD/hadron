\title{Fit Pseudo Scalar Sector}
\description{
  fits one or several cosh and sinh to data for extracting the
  pseudo-scalar meson mass, excited states in the pseudo-scalar channel
  and determines decays constant and \eqn{m_\mathrm{PCAC}}{m_paca}

  This is so far only for twisted mass lattice QCD in the twisted basis.

  }
  \item{ind.vec}{
    index vector indexing the column numbers in cmicor to be used
  }

    number of masses to be extracted. This argument will set the number
    of exponentials to be used in the fit.

    Note that this is not yet stable for \code{no.masses > 1}.

    The fit routine to be used. Default is \dQuote{gsl}, which uses the
    gnu scientific library \dQuote{gsl_multifit_fdfsolver} solver to
    minimise the chisquare. All other values lead to the usage of R's
    \link{optim} function. The latter choice might be significantly
    slower.

\details{
  A call to \code{pion} returns an object, for which several generic
  functions are available, such as \code{summary} and \code{plot}. The
  function should always be used by also considering the output of
  \code{plot}. In particular, in case of the gamma matrix method it
  should always be checked whether the autocorrelation function could be
  integrated in a sensible way. For this reason the autocorrelation
  function is plotted as well as the integrated autocorrelation time as
  a function of the cut-off value for the integral. Obviously, the
  autocorrelation function should be zero at the cut-off and for larger
  values only fluctuate around zero. In other words, the autocorrelation
  time should reach a plateau. Changing the parameter \code{S} (see
  above) allows to influence the automatic determination of the cut-off
  value (see \code{\link{uwerr}} for details).

  Another useful check is also to devide the full ensemble into two (or more)
  sub-ensembles (using the parameter \code{nrep}). The summary function
  will then also compute a Q-value, which should be larger than
  \eqn{0.1} at least for the error to be trustworthy. Otherwise the
  autocorrlation times are presumably too large to determine the error
  reliably.

  Finally it is also usefull to check the value of \eqn{\chi}{chi} per
  data point. Such a plot is produced when \code{plot} is used. 

  The data must be ordered as in the output of
  \code{\link{readcmicor}}, see \code{help(readcmicor)} for details.
  
  The expected order of gamma matrices and operators (local-local,
  local-fuzzed, fuzzed-local and fuzzed-fuzzed) (fuzzed = non-local)
  is as follows for all charged mesons:
  
  1) the 4 operators for each type must be sorted like local-local,
  local-fuzzed, fuzzed-local and fuzzed-fuzzed. (fuzzed=non-local)
  
  2) The 20 available types must be in the following order:\cr
  order PP PA AP AA 44 P4 4P A4 4A   for pion like  \eqn{P=\gamma_5}{P=g5} \eqn{A=\gamma_4\gamma_5}{A=g4g5} \eqn{4=\gamma_4}{4=g4}\cr
  order 44 VV AA 4V V4 4A A4 VA AV   for rho-a1 like \eqn{4=\gamma_i\gamma_4}{4=gig4} \eqn{V=\gamma_i}{V=gi} \eqn{A=\gamma_i\gamma_5}{A=gig5}\cr
  order BB SS   - total 20    \eqn{\gamma_i\gamma_4\gamma_5}{B=gig4g5}\cr
  \eqn{S=I}
  
  In this routine only PP PA AP AA 44 P4 4P A4 4A are used. See also \code{cmicor}!

  (cases with space index "i" are summed over i=1,2,3)
  (best choice is weaker coupling at sink - ie PA rather than AP\cr
  order of magnitudes \eqn{P > 4 > A}  (4 mixes A)\cr
  order of magnitudes \eqn{4\sim A > V}{4 ~ A > V}  (A mixes V))\cr
  
  itype=21 is conserved vector current at sink,  \eqn{\gamma_5}{g5} at source 
  ( iobs is LV  1,  FV  5 )

  pion will perform a fit of of the following matrix
  \tabular{lcccccc}{
    \tab PL \tab PF \tab AL \tab AF \tab 4L \tab 4F \cr

  }
  for coupling parameter \eqn{p_1} to \eqn{p_6} and a mass \eqn{m_\mathrm{PS}}{mps} entering
  \eqn{\cosh}{cosh} (and \eqn{\sinh}{sinh} in the same way) as
  \eqn{\cosh(-m_\mathrm{PS}(T/2-t))}{cosh(-mps(T/2-t))}. The values of \eqn{t} are
  running from \code{t1} to \code{t2} as specified by the user.

  Corresponding to the value of \code{matrix.size} only a submatrix of
  the matrix given above is fitted. Moreover, if \code{no.masses} larger
  than one additional masses and coupling parameters are introduced.

  The pion decay constant is computed from the relation
  \deqn{f_\mathrm{PS} = 4\kappa\mu\frac{p_1}{\sqrt{m_\mathrm{PS}}^3}}{%
    fps = 4 kappa mu p_1/sqrt(mps)^3}
  and the PCAC mass (for \code{matrix.size} > 2) from
  \deqn{m_\mathrm{PCAC} = m_\mathrm{PS} \frac{p_3}{2p_1}}{%
    mpcac = mps p_3/(2 p_1)}
  when the \code{\link{summary.pionfit}} function is called.
  For \code{matrix.size} > 4 also \eqn{Z_V} is computed as
  \deqn{Z_\mathrm{V}=\frac{2\mu}{m_\mathrm{PS}}\frac{p_1}{p_5}}{%
    Z_V = 2 mu p_1/(mps p_5)}
