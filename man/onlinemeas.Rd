\usage{
onlinemeas(data, t1, t2, S=1.5, pl=FALSE, skip=0,
           iobs=1, ind.vec=c(1,3,4,5),
           boot.R=99, boot.l=10, tsboot.sim="geom",
           method="uwerr", fit.routine="optim", nrep,
           oldnorm = FALSE)

}
\arguments{
  \item{data}{
    data to be fitted to as e.g. the output of
    \code{\link{readcmicor}}. Currently only
    \code{\link{cmicor}} format is supported.
  }
  \item{t1}{
    lower bound for the fitrange in time (t1,t2). Counting starts with 0.
  }
  \item{t2}{
    upper bound for the fitrange in time (t1,t2). Counting starts with 0.
  }
  \item{S}{
    passed to \code{uwerr}, see documentation of \code{\link{uwerr}}.
  }
  \item{pl}{
    logical: if set to TRUE the function produces plots
  }
  \item{skip}{
    number of measurements to be discarded at the beginning of the time
    series. \code{skip} has no effect if two or more replica are used,
    see argument \code{nrep}.
  }
  \item{iobs}{
    if there are several operators available (local-local,
    local-smeared, etc.), then this labels these (for cmi format)
  }
  \item{ind.vec}{
    index vector indexing the column numbers in cmicor to be used
  }
  \item{boot.R}{
    number of bootstrap samples for bootstrap analysis
  }
  \item{boot.l}{
    average block size for blocking analysis with tsboot
  }
  \item{tsboot.sim}{
    The type of simulation required to generate the replicate
    time series. See \code{\link{tsboot}} for details.
  }
  \item{method}{
    the type of error analysis to be used. Can be either \dQuote{uwerr},
    \dQuote{boot}, \dQuote{all} or \dQuote{no}. For \dQuote{no} (or any
    other string) no error analysis is performed. This might be helpful
    for a first impression and also to test different initial values for
    the fitting parameters. The latter is in particular needed for more
    than one state in the fit.
  }
  \item{nrep}{
    vector (N1, N2, ...) of replica length N1, N2. If missing it is
    assumed that there is only one ensemble. If there are two or more
    replica the parameter \code{skip} has no effect.
  }
  \item{fit.routine}{
    The fit routine to be used. Default is \dQuote{gsl}, which uses the
    gnu scientific library \dQuote{gsl_multifit_fdfsolver} solver to
    minimise the chisquare. All other values lead to the usage of R's
    \link{optim} function. The latter choice might be significantly
    slower.
  }
  \item{oldnorm}{
    If set to \dQuote{TRUE}, the old online measurement normalisation of
    \dQuote{tmLQCD} prior to version 5.2.0 is used in order to get correct
    values for the pion decay constant.
  }
}

  }

  }
  \item{t1}{
    lower bound for the fitrange in time (t1,t2). Counting starts with 0.

  \item{N}{

    Time extent found in the data

    between \code{t1} and \code{t2}

}
\details{
  The online measurements in the HMC code compute the PP and PA
  correlation functions summed over spatial x for all t. We analyse
  these correlators in different ways:

  \item only the PP correlator is analysed and fitted by
  \eqn{p_1^2\cosh(-m(t-T/2))}{p1*p1*cosh(-m(t-T/2))} for \eqn{m} and
  \eqn{p_1}{p1}.
  
  \item PP and PA correlators are fitted together with three parameters
  as \eqn{C_\mathrm{PP} = p_1^2\cosh(-m(t-T/2))}{C_PP =
    p1*p1*cosh(-m(t-T/2))} and \eqn{C_\mathrm{PA} =
    p_1p_2\cosh(-m(t-T/2))}{C_PA = p1*p2*cosh(-m(t-T/2))} in a
  simultaneous fit. \eqn{m} is then the pseudo scalar mass and the pcac
  mass is determined from
  \deqn{m_\mathrm{PCAC} = m_\mathrm{PS} \frac{p_2}{2p_1}}{%
    mpcac = mps p_2/(2 p_1)}

  \item the PCAC mass can also be determined computing
  \deqn{m_\mathrm{PCAC}(t) =%
    \frac{C_\mathrm{PA}(t+1)-C_\mathrm{PA}(t-1)}{4C_\mathrm{PP}(t)}}{%
    C_PA(t) = (C_PA(t+1)-C_PA(t-1))/(4 C_PP(t))}
  using the symmetric finite difference operator.
