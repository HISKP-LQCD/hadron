Sample rw data
}
\description{
Sample data for reweighting factors suited for samplecf. It was
generated by Gaussian rng with mean = 1 and sd = 0.1. 
We also store its inverse as samplerw_inverse in order to checked
that apply rw and its inverse one after another do not have any
effect at all on a correlation function.
