#' Folds the non-empty list with the binary function
#' 
#' A right fold without the need for a neutral element. Does not work with
#' empty lists.
#' 
#' 
#' @param f \code{function}. A binary function that takes two elements of the
#' type contained in \code{xs} and returns another such element.
#' @param xs \code{list} or vector. Homogenious list or vector of elements.
#' 
#' There is a \code{Reduce} function in base R that does left and right folds.
#' It always needs a starting element, which usually is the neutral element
#' with respect to the binary operation. We do not want to specify such a
#' neutral element for certain operations, like \code{+.cf}. Still a functional
#' programming style should be supported such that one can use maps and folds.
#' @examples
#' 
#' # We generate some random numbers.
#' numbers <- rnorm(10)
#' 
#' # The sum is easiest computed with the `sum` function:
#' sum(numbers)
#' 
#' # If we wanted to implement `sum` ourselves, we can use a right fold to do
#' # so:
#' Reduce(`+`, numbers, 0.0)
#' 
#' # With this new function we do not need a neutral element any more, but give
#' # up the possibility to fold empty lists.
#' foldr1(`+`, numbers)
#' 
#' @export foldr1
foldr1 <- function (f, xs) {
  l <- length(xs)
  stopifnot(l > 0)

  if (l == 1)
    return (xs[[1]])
  else
    return (Reduce(f, xs[2:l], xs[[1]]))
}
