#' @title check if group names exist in HDF5 file
#' @description The group names in an HDF5 file are stored as full paths
#'              as well as a flat vector. It is thus possible to check
#'              if a particular set of group names exist in the file
#'              by parsing the \code{name} member of the output
#'              of \code{h5ls}. This function does just that.
#' @param h5f HDF5 file openend with \code{H5Fopen}
#' @param nms_to_find Vector of strings, group names (not full paths) which
#'                    are to be located in the file.
#' @return Vector of booleans of the same length as \code{nms_to_find}
#'         indicating whether the name at the same index position
#'         was located in the file.
